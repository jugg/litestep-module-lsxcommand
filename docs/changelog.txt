       the current mouse position)
     - Aliases now properly parse out stuff like the following:
       *CommandAlias IE "C:\program files\internet explorer\..."
       Thanks to TAMUKI-TAM for sending the patch to this bug.

     New Features
     ````````````
     - LSXCommand is now offered in Japanese.. TAMUKI-TAM is the guy

       Japanese - thanks again!
     - Added following !Bang commands (see section II.3 for details):

       * !CommandToggleTimer / !CommandClockToggleTimer

     New Features
     ````````````
     - When !CommandMove/!CommandClockMove is called without

       recommend using CommandHideOnUnfocus with this.
       Also, if you !CommandMove has the parameter "home", it moves
       back to the original position found in step.rc
     - Added following RC Commands:

       * Command + Bottom | Top | Left | Right + BorderSize
         (ie. CommandTopBorderSize, CommandLeftBorderSize...)

     Notes
     `````
     Be *sure* to read the CommandBorderSize documentation if you

     Documentation Changes
     `````````````````````
     - Fixed Ilkka Nisula's name.
     - Updated Search Engine list documentation to reflect
       "categories"
     - Updated Section II.1 to note that new engines are only added

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed !CommandBrowse* crashes

       * ZDNet HotFiles

   Version 1.7.4
   -------------
   Bug fixes, bug fixes, bug fixes...

     Documentation Changes
     `````````````````````
     - Documentation now reflects change from CommandClock to
       CommandTime

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed AlterScript to work like Killarny's script.dll
       Meaning, understanding the LoadScript RC Commands
     - Fixed !CommandBrowseFile & !CommandBrowseFolder crashing bugs
     - Fixed CommandCommaDelimiter problems (stupid infinite loops)
     - Fixed the weird LSXCommand/CommandClock problem: if you have
       the *original* LSXCommand with a CommandClock entry, then
       you must change this to CommandTime (see Notes for more info)

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Added switch WinAmp/Clock mode on mouse click in
       LSXCommandClock (not in LSXCommand).
     - Added following RC Commands:

       * CommandAddExternalsToHistory

     - Added following search engines:

       * AudioFindMP3 (MP3 search engine - audiofind.com)
       * PalaVista    (MP3 metacrawler - palavista.com)

     Notes
     `````
     It turns out the problem lies in LSAPI, and not LSXCommand or
     LSXCommandClock.  In any case, the original CommandClock RC
     Command (before there ever was a LSXCommandClock) now is named
     CommandTime.  The LSXCommandClock RC Command "CommandClockString"
     is still the same.  So, if you have the original LSXCommand still
     with a CommandClock entry, change it to CommandTime.  NOTE:
     CommandClockDisappearsOnFocus is still the same.

       Example: CommandClock "#c"  -->  CommandTime "#c"

   Version 1.7.3
   -------------
   A couple of features, bug fixes

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed File AutoComplete junk characters error

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Separate AlterScript module (see section II.11 for details)
     - Separate clock module (see section II.10 for details)
     - Added following !Bang Commands:

       * !CommandBrowseFile
       * !CommandBrowseFolder

   Version 1.7.2
   -------------
   Mostly bug fixes & two feature additions

     Documentation Changes
     `````````````````````
     - Added section II.9 for Tab File Completion feature

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed !CommandHide & !CommandShow problems
     - Fixed CommandHiddenOnStart problems (again)
     - Fixed Paste menu item problems

     New Features
     ````````````
     - New positioning system (see Notes below)
     - Added file name tab completion like Re5ource's popups
       (see section II.9)
     - Added following RC Commands (see section II.2 for details)

       * CommandSearchEngineBrowser
       * CommandWinAmpDisappearsOnFocus
       * CommandHideOnUnfocus
       * CommandTabFileComplete
       * CommandOffsetX
       * CommandOffsetY

     Notes
     `````
     In the new positioning system, CommandOffsetX/Y are used to
     decide from where LSXCommand should compute its position.  The
     following table lists the combinations of CommandOffsetX/Y and
     CommandX/Y and what they do:

       CommandOffsetX/Y:
         0  -  Reference from Left/Top (default)
         1  -  Reference from Center of Horizontal/Vertical
         2  -  Reference from Right/Bottom

       CommandX/Y:
         These values now tell how many pixels away from the point
         described by CommandOffsetX/Y LSXCommand should be.

     For instance, using the following values will have LSXCommand
     be placed 2 pixels to the left of horizontal center, at the very
     bottom of the screen:

       CommandOffsetX 1
       CommandOffsetY 2
       CommandX      -2
       CommandY      -14  (Same as negative of CommandHeight)

     If you leave your settings the way they are, they will work as
     before.

     To turn on file name tab completion, be sure to turn *on*
     CommandTabFileComplete and CommandNoTabMicroComplete.  I know
     this is a bit clunky, but deal with it please... :)  I didn't
     test it too extensively, but it seems to be working quite
     well on my system..  Of course, we know what that means...

   Version 1.7.1
   -------------
   Just bug fixes and a few features

     Documentation Changes
     `````````````````````
     - Added number conversion information to Calculator
       Functionality section (section II.6)
     - Added multiple number bases information to Calculator
       Functionality section (section II.6)
     - Changed the original lscommand's readme file.  Many
       people asked about why CommandHideOnStart doesn't work.
       This is because there is no such thing.. it is
       CommandHiddenOnStart.  That solves that mess.

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed Comma Delimiter problem(s)
     - Caught up with the Kudos section of this readme. :)
     - Fixed bug with CommandContextMenuOrder
     - Fixed Clock that never came back after a command
     - Fixed any problems with CommandHiddenOnStart with
       CommandBackground

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Calculator supports limited number converion
     - Calculator supports binary & hexadecimal numbers (see section
       II.6)
     - You can now stop any of the History / Alias / Search Engine
       submenus from coming up by setting them to 9 instead of 0, 1,
       or 2.
     - Added following RC Commands (see section II.2 for details)

       * CommandScrollWinAmpTitle
       * CommandContextMenuStandardItems

     - Added following !Bang Commands (see section II.3 for details)

       * !Command
       * !CommandShow
       * !CommandHide

     - Added following search engines (see section II.1 for details)

       * OLGA  - On-Line Guitar Archive
       * UBL   - Ultimate Band List
       * CDNow - Search for CDs

     Notes
     `````
     CommandScrollWinAmpTitle scrolls the current WinAmp title *if*
     WinAmp's "Scroll Song Title in Windows Taskbar" preference is
     on.  Also, you *can* have a clock and the WinAmp scroller - but
     the WinAmp scroller takes precedence.  Therefore, the WinAmp
     scroller will show when there is a WinAmp to scroll.  If not,
     LSXCommand will show a clock (if the clock setting is specified)

   Version 1.7
   -----------
   New features...

     Documentation Changes
     `````````````````````
     NOTE: This section notifies you about changes to existing
     documentation.  New documentation is not listed here.  Pay
     close attention to Section II, since all major features have
     their own documentation added under this section.

     - Added note about RPN functionality to Calculator section II.6
     - Added shameless plug <g> for the full engines.list at my web
       site in section II.4.

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Proper handling of border sizes (retheming may be required)

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Added following RC Commands (see section II.2 for details)

       * CommandNoAutoComplete
       * CommandCommaDelimiter
       * CommandTransparentEditBox
       * CommandBackground
       * CommandRPNCalculator
       * CommandClock
       * CommandClockDisappearsOnFocus

     Notes
     `````
     While doing some theming of LSXCommand myself, I noticed that
     when I set BorderSize to 0, it still had a border around it.
     I fixed that kind of stuff in this revision.  NOTE: Some re-
     theming may be required.

     If you set CommandTransparentEditBox on for whatever reason, you
     *WILL* see flashing while typing in the command box.  No doubt.
     I strongly suggest reading section II.2 for more about
     transparency and backgrounds.

   Version 1.5.3
   -------------
   Just a couple of bug fixes in the new command parser from 1.5.2
   and another feature.

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed the junk characters being launched as an Internet
       Address when CommandAssumeNetAddress is turned on.
     - Fixed history saving commands that were quoted paths alone
       multiple times
     - Fixed multiple explorer windows

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Added following RC Commands (see section II.2 for details)

       * CommandSelectAllOnMouseFocus
       * CommandExplorePaths

   Version 1.5.2
   -------------
   More bug fixes - most related to string parsing and memory
   allocation.  Programmers: forgive me!  I didn't check all the
   NULL pointers I was supposed to!  I only hope I caught all of
   them in this release...

   Quote of the release: What was I smoking when I released 1.5.1
   anyway?

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed Calculator () crashing bug
     - Fixed multiple history menu entries of same command
     - Fixed times when history menu wouldn't do anything
     - Fixed No-Argument searching (not possible now)
     - Fixed case when CommandNewestHistoryItemsOnTop was *not* on
     - Fixed LSXCommand hiding / showing itself on inappropriate
       commands from the context menu
     - Fixed command parsing by rewriting code - woopee!!

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Totally re-written command parser  (This is also a bug fix)
     - Added following engines:

       * IMDB	- Search for movies by title at imdb.com

     Notes
     `````
     This section will just comment on the new command parser, since
     it's not big enough for it's own section.

     The new command parser allows for anything to be quoted.
     However, do NOT try and use quoted names for aliases and search
     engines in your configuration files yet - they just aren't
     implemented.  I want this release to entirely stabilize before
     adding other features and moving on to other stuff for a while.

     Anyway, back to the parser.  Before, things like this would not
     run: (Let's say you have an alias of: nt notepad)

       "nt" c:\litestep\step.rc <ENTER>
       "nt c:\litestep\step.rc" <ENTER>

     The first, now, *will* run.  The second *will NOT* run.  This
     should be obvious: the first explicitly says nt is a command
     of its own.  The second says the whole line is a command of its
     own.  Since there is no command that fits this at all, nothing
     will happen.

     Also, quoted paths are now allowed.  So, you can now use

       "c:\program files\something"

     to launch files.

     LSXCommand now operates in the following fashion when given a
     command:

       - Try against Aliases
       - See if it fits !Bang / Calculator / Search
       - If not, try to execute the command and parsed arguments
       - If this does not work, but the command *was* a path,
         then try the whole line alone.  If it wasn't a path,
         your AssumeNetAddress setting kicks in and decides whether
         or not to launch your browser.
